        <div id="answer">
          <p>A mental health professional can help you determine whether you truly have social media addiction or just really enjoy using it a lot. But there are a few key differences between social media addiction and a habit that you enjoy. These include: negative effects to your job or school work due to the overuse of social media, increased use during other activities, such as hanging out with friends and family, or while eating, and/ or increased reliance on social media as a way to cope with problems.

        <div id="answer">
          <p>As more Americans have adopted social media, the social media user base has also grown more representative of the broader population.

          <div id="answer">
            <p>Although social media can allow people to reach out and connect with others, it can also make some people feel worse. Many studies have found an association between time spent on social media as well as the number of social media platforms used, and symptoms of depression and anxiety.7,11 Most of these studies indicate that time spent on social media is correlated with depression and anxiety, but that doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that social media causes these problems.</p>

          <div id="answer">
            <p>While social media can seem like mindless and relaxing fun, it actually has a significant effect on your brain. Whenever you log on to your favorite apps, dopamine signals in your brain increase. These neurotransmitters are associated with pleasure. When you experience more dopamine after using social media, your brain identifies this activity as a rewarding one that you ought to repeat. Such a reaction may be more felt whenever you make a post of your own and gain positive feedback. Check our <a href="resources.html"><span class="blueText">resource</span></a> page to learn more.</p>
